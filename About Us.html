					"I think I could turn and live with the animals, they are so placid and self contained. I stand and look at them long and long.<br>
					They do not sweat and whine about their condition;<br>
					They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins;<br>
					They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God;<br>
					Not one is dissatisfied-not one is demented with the mania of owning things;<br>
					Not one kneels to another, nor his kind that lived thousands of years ago;<br>
					Not one is responsible or industrious over the whole earth."

					<p style="font-size: 18px;">CENTRAL zoo is one of the biggest zoo in the town. The land area of the zoo is 33 acres. CENTRAL zoo was established in the year 1980 with 10 acre land but lately it was modified and land area was also added in the year 2000. Proper residing space for all the type of animals has been made and maintains human security at high rate. Proper supply of food for all the animals is maintained and checked at regular intervals. The predecessor of the central zoo is the menagerie, which has a long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Hierakonpolis, Egypt in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included hippopotami, hartebeest, elephants, baboons and wildcats. King Ashur-bel-kala of the Middle Assyrian Empire created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the Chinese Empress Tanki had a "house of deer" built, and King Wen of Zhou kept a 1,500-acre (6.1 km2) zoo called Ling-Yu, or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, queen Semiramis and King Ashurbanipal of Assyria, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; Alexander the Great is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in the arena, the latter faring notoriously poorly.</p>

						The Central Park Zoo was built OLD SIGN AT ENTRANCE TO CENTRAL PARK ZOO over the course of eight months in 1934 by workers employed by the Civil Works Administration and, after that program’s demise, by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. It succeeded the old Central Park Menagerie, a once popular attraction that by the early 1930s was so severely dilapidated that Parks Department officials feared its lions and tigers would break out of the rotted wood structures that housed them. Newly-appointed Parks Commissioner Robert Moses set about replacing the menagerie, not with a full-sized zoo, but with what he called a “picture-book zoo”—a smaller-scale facility meant as a delightful place for the city’s children. Hoping to take advantage of CWA funding before that temporary program was scheduled to expire, Moses directed architect Aymar Embury II and his team to work quickly; they did, finishing their design in a mere sixteen days. One thousand CWA workers were soon laboring around the clock on the project, continuing into the morning by the light of carbide flares. When the CWA wound down in the spring of 1934, the city’s Emergency Relief Bureau (with contributions from the FERA) absorbed it.Later, Moses foraged eight granite eagle statues from a demolition project. They were created in for the bridge that went over Shore Road from First Avenue in Brooklyn. The bridge was later demolished for the construction of the Gowanus Parkway and the eight eagles were sent to the Central Park Zoo . Originally 4 of them were at the corners of seal pool, but they were moved in the 1988 renovation.

						Central Park was originally established in the 1860s, but New Deal workers carried out massive improvements to the park from 1934 to 1938. In addition to the many specific projects listed by name, there were any number of improvements done with the help of book zoo”—a smaller-scale facility meant as a delightful place for the city’s children. Hoping to take advantage of CWA funding before that temporary program was scheduled to expire, Moses directed architect Aymar Embury II and his team to work quickly; they did, finishing their design in a mere sixteen days. One thousand CWA workers were soon laboring around the clock on the project, continuing into the morning by the light of carbide flares. When the CWA wound down in the spring of 1934, the city’s Emergency Relief Bureau (with contrrelief labor paid for by New Deal programs (WPA and FERA). Afterward, the lobby walls was covered floor to ceiling with murals by Allen Saalburg and his assistants. Saalburg was the WPA’s Director of Murals for the NYC Parks Department.

As Frank da Cruz explains, New Deal funds, labor, and designers reconstructed the park, with thousands of men working in three shifts around the clock in all weather. They built new walls and entrance markers; removed dead trees and pruned others; plowed, seeded, planted, and revived the landscaping; created new footpath, trails, and drainage; and installed drinking fountains, lighting, benches, trash containers, and fences throughout the park.

						Until the early 19th century, the function of the zoo was often to symbolize royal power, like King Louis XIV's menagerie at Versailles. The modern zoo that emerged in the 19th century in the United Kingdom, was focused on providing scientific study and later educational exhibits to the public for entertainment and inspiration. A growing fascination for natural history and zoology, coupled with the tremendous expansion in the urbanization of London, led to a heightened demand for a greater variety of public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos.
